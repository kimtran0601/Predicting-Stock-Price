They have the $$ to promote biodegradable alternatives and make an impact in the industry and culture at large, but no let's keep the petrolleum companies and plastic going for no reason... it takes the culture demanding change though which we are not doing. It shouldn't be considered \"cool\" to be wasteful in society. The new \"cool standard\" we should care to embody is being mindful, caring, high standard/ values person, not a lazy consumer...

            "Preparing the best cup of coffee involves several factors, including selecting high-quality coffee beans, using the right brewing method, and paying attention to details. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you make an exceptional cup of coffee:\n1. **Start with Quality Coffee Beans:**\n - Choose freshly roasted coffee beans from a reputable source. Look for beans labeled with the roast date.\n - Consider the coffee's origin, flavor profile, and roast level to match your taste preferences.\n2. **Use Clean Equipment:**\n - Ensure that your coffee maker, grinder, and any other equipment you use are clean and free of old coffee residues, which can negatively affect the taste.\n3. **Measure Your Coffee:**\n - Use a kitchen scale to measure your coffee grounds accurately. The general guideline is 1 to 2 tablespoons of coffee per 6 ounces of water, but you can adjust this to suit your taste.\n4. **Grind Fresh:**\n - Grind your coffee beans just before brewing to preserve freshness and flavor. The grind size should match your brewing method (e.g., coarse for French press, fine for espresso).\n5. **Use Quality Water:**\n - Start with clean, filtered water free from impurities and strong odors. Water quality greatly influences the taste of your coffee.\n6. **Control Water Temperature:**\n - Ideal water temperature for brewing coffee is between 195°F to 205°F (90°C to 96°C). If your water is boiling, let it cool for a minute before pouring it over the coffee grounds.\n7. **Brewing Methods:**\n - Choose a brewing method that suits your preferences. Some popular methods include:\n - Drip Coffee Maker\n - Pour-Over\n - French Press\n - Espresso Machine\n - AeroPress\n - Cold Brew\n8. **Brewing Time:**\n - Pay attention to the brewing time. Over-brewing can lead to bitterness, while under-brewing may result in weak coffee. Follow the recommended time for your chosen method.\n9. **Proper Extraction:**\n - Ensure even extraction by stirring the coffee grounds or using a proper bloom and pour-over technique, depending on your method.\n10. **Enjoy Freshly Brewed Coffee:**\n - Coffee is at its best when freshly brewed. Serve it immediately to savor th",
