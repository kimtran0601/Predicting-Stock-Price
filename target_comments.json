As a dedicated service provider, we pride ourselves on fostering professional relationships with our esteemed clients and anticipate a similar ethos from them.\n\nIt is with a heavy heart that we bring this concern to the public domain after our consistent efforts to address it privately were met with silence. Our collaboration with Alikay Naturals involved the provision of two committed Virtual Assistants from our end. Despite their unwavering commitment and diligence, we find ourselves awaiting remuneration for the services delivered. The pending amount has now escalated to several thousands of dollars.\n\nOur team has reached out to Alikay Naturals and @therochellegraham multiple times through diverse communication channels, including emails and direct messages. Regrettably, our endeavors have been overlooked. It's disconcerting to witness businesses, particularly those with a substantial digital footprint, sidestepping their commitments.\n\nBeyond the immediate concern of unpaid dues, there lies a more profound issue. This isn't merely about unsettled invoices but the inherent value and regard for industrious individuals, particularly those hailing from developing nations. Exploiting service providers from these regions isn't only morally questionable but also contradicts the tenets of fair trade and reciprocal respect. Every individual, irrespective of their geographic origin, is entitled to dignified treatment and just compensation for their contributions.\n\nWe earnestly appeal to Alikay Naturals and CEO Rochelle Graham to address this pressing concern. We remain optimistic about the potential of constructive dialogue and are keen on amicable resolution. However, our commitment to justice and the rightful treatment of all service providers remains unwavering.\n\n#StandForJustice #FairTrade #ValueEveryService #AlikayNaturals", "hey @fentybeauty i'm casting LGBT modeling shoots, can you hook me up with someone to talk about recs? product or models", "What time do Stanley cups release online tomorrow?", "@el.aviv AGREED\u2026.never again Target", "Chef knives set on sale \ud83d\udd2a buy now for the holiday gifts.
